# TruMailer

TruMailer is a lightweight and fast **email validation API** built to help developers check whether an email address is valid, disposable, role-based, or spammy.  
It’s simple to use, easy to deploy, and designed for speed.

## 📋 Data Sources

TruMailer leverages community-maintained datasets to provide accurate email validation:

- **[Allowlist Domains](https://github.com/disposable-email-domains/disposable-email-domains/blob/main/allowlist.conf)** - Trusted email providers that should not be blocked
- **[Disposable Email Blocklist](https://github.com/disposable-email-domains/disposable-email-domains/blob/main/disposable_email_blocklist.conf)** - Comprehensive list of temporary email providers

These datasets are regularly updated to ensure optimal detection accuracy.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Syntax validation (RFC compliant)
- 📨 MX record lookup (checks if domain can receive mail)
- 🛑 Disposable email detection (tempmail, 10minutemail, etc.)
- 👥 Role-based email detection (admin@, support@, info@, etc.)
- ⚡ REST API with JSON responses
- 🔒 Lightweight and privacy-first (no data stored)
